Let's suppose you have a client who wants a to startup a custom designed/printed T shirt manufacturing company. You are hired as the consultant/PM to develop a mobile app or a  website for the startup. Which mode of development would you prefer and how would you go about the planning for the app/website?

For a startup company in my opinion the incremental model would be the one to choose. Since for a startup company its all about the branding and if we are to go on all full fledged on the website and the application it will only increase the overall cost without any assurance if the customers are going to be on board and like the product. So intially with respect to the requirements of the customers and the client I would suggest to add only the basic features in the website like browsing, ordering/adding to cart, checkout and so on. So the first two increments would be to focus on the most flexible way the customers can interact with the system and secondly to focus on the branding of the company. For the later increments, by gaining in the feedbacks from the users like any inflexibility in the system or ideas aboyt any new features to increase the users experience or even some bug reports; so gardually we can pitch in those ideas and feedbacks from the users in an efficient manner in the later increments while also focusing on the product. Parallely with these developmental phases I would suggest to also focus on marketing of the product. As it is very important to be able to reach more users/customers for the growth of the product.
